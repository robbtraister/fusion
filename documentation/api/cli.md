# Fusion CLI

Fusion applications should be managed by the [Fusion Command Line utility found on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arc-fusion/cli). You can find a full list of the commands it offers and their purpose in that repository's documentation.

> **NOTE**
>
> Do NOT confuse the `@arc-fusion/cli` NPM package with the `fusion-cli` package created by Uber. Even though they have the same name, Arc's Fusion product is different... and better. Obviously, their CLI will not work with Arc Fusion Feature Packs.
