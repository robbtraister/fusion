# Fusion API Documentations Style Guide

## Document Format

- Each API doc will have a "title" at the top denoted by an `h1` tag
- Each API doc will have a "description" immediately following the Title denoted by a paragraph
- API docs can have different "sections" regarding how developers should implement a given API, or the information or functionality provided by that API. Sections should be denoted by `h2` tags
- "Items" are instances of information or functionality being documented. These could include properties provided to the developer by that API, or functions/methods the API makes available. Items should be denoted by `h3` tags. Items should include the "type" for that item at the end of the `h3` if relevant (e.g. "String", "Object", "Function").
- Items can contain different "meta-information". These might include a list of arguments the item takes (if it is a function), an example of the item in use, etc. Meta-information should be denoted by `h5` tags.
